Zeos Database Objects is a Delphi's components set for direct
access to OpenSource databases: MySql, PostgreSql, Interbase, DB2.
Also we propose components for direct access to commerce
databases: MS SQL, SyBase SQL and Oracle.

Zeos Database Objects support Delphi 3, Delphi 4, Delphi 5, Delphi 6,
Delphi 7, C++ Builder 4, C++ Builder 5 and Kylix.

Note: Support Delphi 7 do not full and ported only Core and PostgreSql
components. Some parameters for tune components plased in file Zeos.inc
 
Package contains following components:

Dbware crossdatabase components

  TZUpdateSql - component for manual managing of postings.
  TZBatchSql - component for executing sql scripts
  TZMonitor - viewing outgoing queries

Direct access to MySql

  TZMySqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZMySqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZMySqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZMySqlTable - opening tables

Direct access to PostgreSql 7 & 7.2

  TZPgSqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZPgSqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZPgSqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZPgSqlTable - opening tables
  TZPgSqlNotify - register PostgreSql events
  TZPgSqlStoredProc - stored procedures with various parameter types

Notes: For support PostgreSql 7.2 please turn on parameter PGSQL72
and turn off PGSQL7 and for support PostgreSql 7 please turn off parameter 
PGSQL72 end turn on parameter PGSQL7 in file Zeos.inc.


Direct access to Interbase

  TZIbSqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZIbSqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZIbSqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZIbSqlTable - opening tables
  TZIbSqlNotify - register Interbase events
  TZIbSqlStoredProc - stored procedures with various parameter types

Notes: To implement Interbase autoincrement fields create generator
with name "<TableName>_<FieldName>_gen" and turn on 
Query.ExtraOptions[ioAutoIncKey]. Field should be a primary key.
For example: 
  CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerNo INTEGER NOT NULL,
    ...
    PRIMARY KEY (CustomerNo)
  );
  CREATE GENERATOR Customers_CustomerNo_Gen;

  TZDb2SqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZDb2SqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZDb2SqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZDb2SqlTable - opening tables

Direct access to Oracle

  TZOraSqlDatabase - connect to sql-server
  TZOraSqlTransact - postings and transactions manager
  TZOraSqlQuery - execution and opening sql-queries
  TZOraSqlTable - opening tables

Direct access to MS SQL
