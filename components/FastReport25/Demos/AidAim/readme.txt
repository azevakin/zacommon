This demo shows how you can use FastReport VCL with EasyTable.
You should install both products before opening this demo project.
EasyTable is a product of our partner, AidAim Software:

EasyTable:

EasyTable is the BDE alternative providing access to a database in its own format 
in fast and easy way. It contains two components called TEasyTable and TEasyDatabase, 
last one is intended for working with several tables in a single folder. 
TEasyTable is a TTable replacement supporting most of its features such as master/detail,
filtering, searching, sorting, Key and Range methods, BLOB fields and some special ones 
such as data encryption, BLOB data compression, multi-indexes, shareable in memory 
capabilities, in-memory mode and others. EasyTable doesn't use BDE, has small footprint 
and compact database size, provides the extremely fast data access with buffering and 
has the excellent search performance using multi-indexes 
(see http://www.aidaim.com/articles/dbtests1.php for details). 
EasyTable is fully compatible with standard DB-aware visual controls such as 
DBFlyTreeView, QuickReport, FastReport, DBGrid, DBNavigator, DBImage, DBMemo, 
DBRichEdit and others. It supports calculated and lookup fields. 
EasyTable provides data importing from and exporting to any data source. 
It supports internationalization / localization and Unicode. 
Also there are many useful things such as table restructuring, table data restoring, 
displaying progress during slow operations with the table data and so on. 
EasyTable includes some utilities with sources such as EasyTable Manager, a visual utility for 
creating and editing databases and tables as well as importing / exporting data. 
There are valuable help system and many demos for Delphi / C++ Builders in EasyTable 
delivery package. 


FastReport VCL 

FastReport VCL is reporting tool component for Borland Delphi 2-6 and 
Borland C++Builder 3-6. It consists of report engine, designer and preview. 

Some FastReport possibilities are really unique. 
The generator allows you to create tables, queries and databases in run-time. 
Built-in dialog designer allows you creation of dialog forms (they can be used for 
asking some parameters before printing a report). You also able to use built-in 
Pascal-like interpreter to do rather complex data processing. 

In spite of power of FastReport, its code is quite small. Probably FastReport is leader 
in correlation of functionality/size. The FastReport kernel (without designer) adds to 
your program the small footprint (less than QR3), but its functionality is like in 
ReportBuilder's one.
